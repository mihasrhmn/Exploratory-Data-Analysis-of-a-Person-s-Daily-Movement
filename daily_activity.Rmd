## Loading and preprocessing the data
Unzipping the activity.zip file to obtain the csv file and load it into R.

```{r, echo=TRUE}
library("data.table")
library(ggplot2)

unzip("activity.zip")


dataset <- data.table::fread(input = "activity.csv")
```


## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
Questions to answers:
1. Calculating the total number of steps taken per day:

```{r, echo=TRUE}
total_steps <- dataset[, c(lapply(.SD, sum, na.rm = FALSE)), .SDcols = c("steps"), by = .(date)] 

head(total_steps)
```

2. Making a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day:

```{r, echo=TRUE}
ggplot(total_steps, aes(x = steps)) +
    geom_histogram(fill = "#2ab0ff", binwidth = 1000) +
    labs(title = "Total Number of Steps Taken Each Day", x = "Steps Taken", y = "Frequency")
```

3. Calculate and report the mean and median of the total number of steps taken per day:
```{r echo=TRUE}
mean_steps <- mean(total_steps$steps, na.rm = TRUE)
median_steps = median(total_steps$steps, na.rm = TRUE)
mean_steps
median_steps
```

## What is the average daily activity pattern?
1. Making a time series plot (i.e. 𝚝𝚢𝚙𝚎 = "𝚕") of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all days (y-axis)

```{r, echo=TRUE}
interval <- dataset[, c(lapply(.SD, mean, na.rm = TRUE)), .SDcols = c("steps"), by = .(interval)] 

ggplot(interval, aes(x = interval , y = steps)) +
  geom_line(color = "red", size = 1) +
  labs(title = "Average Daily Steps Taken", x = "Interval", y = "Avg. Steps per day")
```

2. Which 5-minute interval, on average across all the days in the dataset, contains the maximum number of steps?

```{r}
max_interval <- interval[steps == max(steps)]
max_interval
```


## Imputing missing values

1. Calculate and report the total number of missing values in the dataset (i.e. the total number of rows with 𝙽𝙰s)

```{r}
sum(is.na(dataset$steps))
```


2. Filling in all of the missing values in the dataset with the median

```{r}
dataset[is.na(steps), "steps"] <- dataset[, c(lapply(.SD, median, na.rm = TRUE)), .SDcols = c("steps")]
```


3. Creating a new dataset that is equal to the original dataset but with the missing data filled in.

```{r}
data.table::fwrite(x = dataset, file = "new_dataset.csv", quote = FALSE)
```


4. Creating a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day and calculate and report the mean and median total number of steps taken per day.


```{r, echo=TRUE}
# Calculating the total number of steps taken per day again:
total_steps <- dataset[, c(lapply(.SD, sum, na.rm = TRUE)), .SDcols = c("steps"), by = .(date)] 

# Creating the new histogram:
ggplot(total_steps, aes(x = steps)) +
    geom_histogram(fill = "#b02aff", binwidth = 1000) +
    labs(title = "Total Number of Steps Taken Each Day (without missing data)", x = "Steps Taken", y = "Frequency")

# Calculating the mean and medium again:
mean_steps <- mean(total_steps$steps, na.rm = TRUE)
median_steps = median(total_steps$steps, na.rm = TRUE)
mean_steps
median_steps
```

Both mean and median values changed significantly after imputing the missing values. Mean changed about 1410.77 units and median changed about 370 units.

## Differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends
1. Creating a new factor variable in the dataset with two levels – “weekday” and “weekend” indicating whether a given date is a weekday or weekend day.
```{r echo=TRUE}
dataset[, date := as.POSIXct(date, format = "%Y-%m-%d")]
dataset[, "day"] <- weekdays(x = dataset$date)
dataset[grepl(pattern = "Monday|Tuesday|Wednesday|Thursday|Friday", x = day), "day_type"] <- "weekday"
dataset[grepl(pattern = "Saturday|Sunday", x = day), "day_type"] <- "weekend"
dataset[, "day_type"] <- as.factor(dataset$day_type)

```
2. Making a panel plot containing a time series plot (i.e. 𝚝𝚢𝚙𝚎 = "𝚕") of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all weekday days or weekend days (y-axis).

```{r echo=TRUE}
interval <- dataset[, c(lapply(.SD, mean, na.rm = TRUE)), .SDcols = c("steps"), by = .(interval, day_type)] 

ggplot(interval , aes(x = interval , y = steps, color = day_type)) +
  geom_line() + 
  labs(title = "Average Daily Steps Taken by Daytype", x = "Interval", y = "No. of Steps Taken") + 
  facet_wrap(~day_type , ncol = 1, nrow=2)
```
